Controls for the physics simulator:
	- Escape : exit the simulation
	- Q : Starts or pauses the simulation
	- R : Slows down the simulation (press again for normal speed)
	- T : Speeds up the situation (press again for normal speed)
	- W : Move forwards
	- S : Move backwards
	- A : Move left
	- D : Move right
	- C : Move down
	- Space : Move up
	- 1 : selects the introduction setup. This setup has nothing interesting in it.
	- 2 : selects the simple forces setup. (Currently not working)
	- 3 : selects the forces and simple velocity setup, where the object travels in 
		  a regular parabola by simple kinematics
	- 4 : selects the simple rocket question (i.e., some amount of propulsion, then free-fall)
	- 5 : selects the variable-mass rocket (which loses fuel as it propels itself)
	- 6 : selects the variable-mass and variable-gravity rocket (i.e., the rocket 
		  loses fuel as it propels itself and the gravity changes based on the height)
	- 7 : selects the orbit demonstration
	- 8 : selects a more complex orbit (Currently not working)
	- 9 : selects the most complex orbit setup.
